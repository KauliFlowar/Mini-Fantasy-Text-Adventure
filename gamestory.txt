Once upon a time, there was a world named Isuren, which was home to many amazing creatures.
Isuren was divided into various kingdoms, each with their own element.
Each kingdom's power rests in an elemental crystal, sealed within the kingdom.
One day, an elemental crystal was stolen and the kingdom's power slowly faded away.
Within a few years, multiple different elemental crystals were stolen and their kingdoms fell.
Soon enough, every single kingdom had lost their elemental crystal.
Then, a prophecy has been spoken about a young hero, who can find and return the crystals from the thief.
Isuren will be saved one day...

I open my eyes.
I feel as if they have been closed for an eternity.
Where am I...?\n
I see a sword right in front of me.
I guess I have no choice but to take it, as it is my only defence out here.
~t2
Suddenly, a hissing sound came from a bush
A worm comes out of the bush and jumps at me
I guess I have no choice but to fight it!
~t3
The worm fled me.
I guess I'm ok for now.\n
I make my way navigating the forest. It wasn't easy.
I was starving. I didn't think it was possible to escape anymore.
Then I hear a voice...
\"Who's there? Come out now.\"
I take a peak. It was a knight in red armor. He must be from the Fire Kingdom.
He spots me and looks surprised.
\"It's ok\", he says. \"I'm not here to hurt you.\"
I come out. \"Hello\" was all I could say to him.
\"What's your name?\", he asks.
My name? My name is...
~t4
\"{0}"? I've heard that name before. You must be the hero.
Me? A hero? What does he mean?
\"Your name was the name that came from a prophecy, which a great mage has foreseen.\"
he said.\n
\"I'm a bit lost right now. I have no idea where I am.\", I said.
\"You are in the Earth Kingdom's forest. I came down here because I heard a person went missing down here.\", he said.
\"I am Nadrus, the Flame Knight. Pleased to meet you.\"
He helped guide me out of the forest and gave me some food.\n
\"Thank you\", I said. \"For everything you've done.\"
Then another knight appeared. He was from the Earth Kingdom.
\"Trespassers are not welcome here.\", he grunted.
Flame Knight looks at you. "{0}"! I'll help you fight him off.
~t5
\"Grrr\", he grunts. \"You won't get away next time.\"
Flame Knight looks at you. \"You fought well, {0}\", he said.
I look at Flame Knight and Smile
\"It was nice knowing you. I must go now.\"
\"{0}! Wait!\" he said.
\"If you are the hero of Isuren, let me join you. I'll protect you.\"
\"Why do want to help me?\", I asked.\n
You see... Fire Kingdom once lived in peace.
Ever since the fire crystal was stolen, our power shrank a lot.
Warring kingdoms would attack us while they still had their crystal.
Some of our people were tortured. Killed. Or worse.
I cannot forgive this crystal thief. So I want to help you on this journey, " + player_name + "\n
\"Alright\", I say. \"You may join me. On the journey to save Isuren...\"
~j1p1
\"Hey {0}.\", said Nadrus.
I look at Nadrus as he holds a piece of paper, smiling.
\"What's up?\", I respond.
He smirks and looks at me. \"I think we need more allies, don't you think?\"
\"Yeah I guess so...\"
\"I know a friend who can help us. He is from the Water Kingdom.\"
\"Well we should go get him. No one is willing to leave the Kingdom walls ever since the crystal was stolen, right?\"
He sighs and looks at the floor. \"You're right. Let's go. Even if there's a chance to die, we need to go.\"\n
We make our way to a crossroad. Which direction should we go? (Left or Right)
~j1p2
It fell to the floor and fainted. We pushed it's corpse away and continued along the road.
\"{0}!\", Nadrus called out. \"You picked the right way. There's Water Kingdom.\"
\"Soon you'll meet my friend, Aurus. He is the Aqua Mage.\"
Aqua Mage? If he is the Aqua Mage, then we would have a healer. I turn to Nadrus.
\"I'm sure he will be of use.\", I say.\n
\"Too bad you wont be able to see him\", a figure calls out.
It walks up to us. It was a person who held a staff of the night sky.
\"We, the Galatigos, have secured the Water Kingdom.\", he smiles.
\"Surrender now or beg for mercy from our Pontifex.\"
Nadrus stands in front of me. \"We have no idea what the Galatigos are, but we are on an important mission, so stay out of our way.\"
\"I'm afraid I can't do that.\"
Nadrus pushes him back. \"Then we will fight.\"
He spins his staff in place. \"Very well then.\"
~j1p3
He collapses onto the floor. \"Y-You'll hear from our Pontifex soon enough.\"
Nadrus pushes him aside and walks into the Water Kingdom.
\"Aurus, are you out here?\", he calls out.
A man with eyes of blue steps out of an alley.
\"Nadrus?\", he calls out. \"It's been a while.\"
Nadrus nods. \"We need your help. I'm with " + player_name + ". He might be able to help us.\"
He gasps. \"" + player_name + "? The chosen one?\"
I smile. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Aurus.\"\n
He shakes your hand and gives a serious face. \"I'll help you.\"
He sees your wounds on your body. \"You're wounded. I'll heal you up.\"
~j2p1
Aurus sits at the table and looks me.
\"I'm going to be completely honest\" he says. \"What if " + player_name + " was just some kid who called themself " + player_name + "?\"
Nadrus puts his hand on Aurus's. \"I know you're on edge because all the Kingdoms have fallen, but we have to trust " + player_name + ".\"
Nadrus looks at me. \"I never doubted you even since the time we met.\"
I sigh in relief. \"Alright, what's are next plan of action?\", I ask.
Aurus sits up straight. \"Maybe we should free Water Kingdom from the control of the Galatigos.\"
\"What even are the Galatigos?\", I ask.
Aurus looks at me. \"Well...\"\n
The Galatigos are a group of organised cultists who try to spread their religion across Isuren.
They worship the stars, planets, and galaxies above them. It's a fine religion, but they spread it in the wrong ways.
The Galatigos bend the galaxy to their will, using the magic of the universe.
Anyone who dares refuse to convert, they will attack them.
Their Pontifex is the most powerful of them all. No one knows her location, so she remains mysterious.\n
\"Alright then, let's free Water Kingdom then.\", Nadrus says.
We start walking towards Water Kingdom.
A person starts walking up to our group.
\"You'll pay for what you did to me last time\", he says.
\"Rats!\", Nadrus curses. \"I knew we should have killed him.\"
\"I'll end you once in for all!\", he says.
